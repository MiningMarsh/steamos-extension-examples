This is the extracted version/source code to the extensions in [this repository](https://github.com/MiningMarsh/steamos-extensions), alongside the `build` script used to create them.

These extensions are meant to be built by the `root` user on a steam deck, just clone this repository somewhere in the `root` user's home directory and `./build` straight from there. Extensions will be deposited in `/var/lib/extensions`.
